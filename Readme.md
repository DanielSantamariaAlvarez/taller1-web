This project was made with pasion and love for practice my skills for front web development.
So, i made a landing page where I show my CV. I included some experiences and information that allow me to be who I am.

The technologies used in this project was HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

The colors that I chose was: 
- Black (#000)
- White (#fff)
- Orange (#e9791a)
- Blue (#4fafff)
- bg-light from bootstrap
